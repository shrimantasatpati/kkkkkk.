With over 15 years experience working across the entire life-cycle of an offshore wind farm we have become a trusted first choice provider of personnel. 

Since the inception of the Renewables market, we have been a major player in this field, with our Renewables team being present for every modern innovation in the industry. We are a knowledge sharing partner, with memberships across leading industry organisations such as RenewableUK, we are also part of the NWEA (Netherlands Wind Energy Association). As well as Wind Europe (previously known as 'EWEA'), at the forefront of facilitating the progression and development of European and global markets. More recently, we have developed ties with the Asia Wind Energy Associate and the US Business Network for Offshore Wind.

We have supported over 75 wind farms and 8 substations in Europe; primarily the UK, Netherlands, Germany, France, Belgium & Denmark and more recently Taiwan and the United States.

Our teams work across the supply chain, from owners such as Orsted and Vattenfall, to survey contractors like Fugro, turbine manufacturers Siemens Gamesa and MHI Vestas, cable manufacturers NKT, Prysmian and JDR. As well as fleet owners such as Bibby, Boskalis and Van Oord. Currently, we are seeing many of our European clients are transitioning into new markets and we are consequently sharing our knowledge and expertise to help them fulfill their future project pipeline.

In 2019, Atlas opened an office in Boston, our second in the US that will work closely with our Houston team to grow the local US workforce. Next to this, the office is set to form close alliances with trade unions, local academic institutes and maritime academies in the US.

The decision to open an office in Boston is based on the city being a leading Bluetech hub and the growing project pipeline of offshore wind energy in the US, where most of the nearer term activity is concentrated in the Atlantic of the Northeast coast.

With 65 years of commitment to excellence and proven expertise in our field, McMillen Jacobs continues to offer our clients unique solutions to their projects. This means our clients enjoy the benefits both of proven, efficient construction methods and of state-of-the-art approaches. With an emphasis on tunnels and shafts, we offer a full range of design and construction management capabilities for both large- and small-diameter tunnels as well as trenchless technologies. McMillen Jacobs engineers have specialized education and practical knowledge in a variety of disciplines required for underground and trenchless projects, including pipe engineering, engineering geology, geotechnical engineering, structural engineering, rock mechanics, construction engineering, and construction contracting. 

During the planning stages, the experts at McMillen Jacobs provide expertise in preliminary studies for alternatives analysis of pipelines vs. tunnel options, evaluating on the basis of constructability, construction costs, and schedule. At this stage, our staff also develops a risk register. This is a particularly helpful tool when approaching utilities relocation or installation where challenges include consideration of nearby utilities, logistical considerations for installation of pipeline bundles inside a casing, maintaining drain pipeline grade within the casing, corrosion protection of steel pipelines, and vertical and lateral support of pipeline in manholes. We provide a full array of design services, including tunnel design, shaft design, excavation support, deep foundations, dewatering, slope stabilization, foundation design, and geotechnical characterization. 

As with our approach to conventional large-diameter tunneling, McMillen Jacobs trenchless technology specialists consider the interplay of the ownerâ€™s functional requirements with the construction processes and geotechnical conditions specific to each project. We understand the full range of small-diameter tunneling and trenchless technologies available to successfully complete any trenchless project. Our trenchless technology experts provide comprehensive servicesâ€”from preliminary and final design to technical and construction supportâ€”for even the most complex projects. Their extensive experience covers the gamut of trenchless construction technologies, including the latest developments in the field, including microtunneling, horizontal directional drilling (HDD), pilot tube guided boring, pipe bursting, pipe ramming, AXIS boring system, auger boring, traditional pipe jacking, hand mining, and utility tunneling. High value trenchless consulting goes beyond just specifying a construction method. At McMillen Jacobs, our experts understand the nuances and risks associated with trenchless technologies. McMillen Jacobs is recognized throughout the trenchless industry, and our engineers regularly make appearances as guest lecturers at seminars and publish technical papers regarding the latest advances in this area of tunneling.
